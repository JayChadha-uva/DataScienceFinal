### Question 1: Visualize duration vs energy. Widgets can choose the two categories, change loess line, filter by album. 
songs

songs %>%
  filter(album %in% c("Let It Be (Remastered)", "The Beatles")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = danceability, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
### Question 2: Boxplot popularity and album. Widgets make you pick a couple of albums, pick variable you want to compare, also filter by a variable.
